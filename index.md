# PathFindR Architecture Documentation

Welcome! This microsite collects the public-facing architecture guides for the PathFindR platform. These pages mirror the source-of-truth Markdown files in the repository and are published automatically via MkDocs whenever we update them.

- [System Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md)
- [Agents & Orchestration](agents-architecture.md)
- [Image Analysis Pipeline](image-analysis-pipeline.md)
- [End-to-End Scan Workflow](image-scan-workflow.md)
- [RAG / Knowledge Architecture](rag-architecture.md)

> Looking for engineering playbooks, historical plans, or internal checklists? Those live under `docs/internal/` inside the repository.
